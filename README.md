**The trust layer for AI agents.** Gates protect your tools. Passports authorize your agents. Everything verified locally.

MCP server for managing the [Uniplex](https://uniplex.ai) trust infrastructure — gates, passports, catalogs, constraints, enforcement, commerce, and billing — directly from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP client.

---

## What is Uniplex?

[Uniplex](https://uniplex.ai) is an open protocol that adds a lightweight trust layer for the agentic web. It has two sides:

**Gates** protect your tools, APIs, and MCP servers. A Gate is a verification checkpoint — you define a permission catalog of what's allowed, and incoming agent requests are checked against it locally, with no network round-trip. Every decision produces a signed attestation for a tamper-evident audit trail.

**Passports** are signed credentials that agents carry. Each passport specifies who issued it, what the agent is allowed to do, and under what constraints — scoped to specific actions, resources, and time windows.

This MCP server lets you manage both sides conversationally from any MCP client.

## Prerequisites

- A **Uniplex account** — sign up at the [Uniplex Dashboard](https://uniplex.ai)
- **Claude Desktop**, **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, or any MCP-compatible client
- An **API key** — generate one from the dashboard

---

## Quick Start

### Connect with API Key (Claude Desktop, any MCP client)

Add Uniplex to your MCP configuration:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uniplex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["uniplex-mcp-manage"],
      "env": {
        "UNIPLEX_API_KEY": "uni_live_xxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Add to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add uniplex \
  --scope user \
  -- npx uniplex-mcp-manage \
  --env UNIPLEX_API_KEY=uni_live_xxxxxxxx
```

Restart your client and you're ready to go.

## Local Development

For local testing against a development dashboard:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "uniplex": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["uniplex-mcp-manage"],
      "env": {
        "UNIPLEX_API_URL": "http://localhost:3000",
        "UNIPLEX_API_KEY": "uni_test_xxxxxxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Server doesn't appear in Claude Desktop**
Make sure you've restarted Claude Desktop after editing the config file. Check for JSON syntax errors in your config.

**"Invalid API key" error**
Verify your key starts with `uni_live_` (production) or `uni_test_` (development) and hasn't been revoked.

**Tools aren't showing up**
Run `npx uniplex-mcp-manage` directly in your terminal to check for startup errors. Ensure Node.js 18+.
